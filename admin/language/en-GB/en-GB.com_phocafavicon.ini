If the PHP error is not displayed below, then it seems, PHP Error Reporting is disabled on your site.  Enable PHP Error Reporting to see the error. Mostly the problem is caused by memory - GD library cannot create a thumbnail from uploaded image. In such case, remove the uploaded image from your server and try to upload image with smaller size (images are stored in images/phocafavicon folder in your Joomla! root directory).</small></div>"
